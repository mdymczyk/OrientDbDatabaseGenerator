# OrientDbDatabaseGenerator

This repository is no longer maintained, might contain bugs. I have tested and used it with [OrientDB 1.7.x](http://orientdb.com/orientdb/).

This repository contains a set of basic annotations, which can be used on your domain model objects to map your database schema. This generator creates the OrientDB schema for you, should you be using the *strict* schema mode and releases your from all the pains of hand crafting it. It does topological sorting before creation so even complex schemas should be supported. Most of the properties of OrientDB classes should work out of the box.

Feel free to use it as you please.
